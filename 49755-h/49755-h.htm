<p class="nind"><span class="letraa">N</span><b>EARLY</b> <i>all these pieces have appeared in the</i> <span class="smcap">Cambridge Review</span>, <i>and I
thank the Editor for his courtesy in allowing me to reprint them. A few
travesties and epigrams have been added, and others have been revised.
Most of the tales were written during the War, many of them while I was
in Flanders, and at that time, being away from books, I imagined I was
doing something new, being either ignorant or forgetful of the work of
better men, such as Lord Dunsany and Mr T. W. H. Crosland, in a very
similar form. To such gentlemen, I can only offer an apology if I seem
to enter their little pleasaunces and tread clumsily where they who went
before me stepped so lightly and delicately.</i></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letraa">A</span> <b>PROFITEER</b>, a Priest of Nebt-het, from Heliopolis, and a Fool were
walking together one day, when they met the grim figure of War belching
flame and fury.</p>

<p>‘Who is that?’ asked the fool and the priest of each other, quickening
their pace. But the profiteer raised his hat, bowed humbly, and stayed
to chat for a few moments with the terrible figure, before rejoining his
companions.</p>

<p>Presently, they came upon Death, mumbling to himself by the roadside.
The fool and the profiteer raised their eyebrows, and passed on, but the
priest of Nebt-het touched his forehead and made certain strange signs
with his hands, to which Death replied in like manner.</p>

<p>Then the three spied a beautiful woman who sat among the wildflowers. It
was Love, combing her hair and singing all the love-songs of the world.
‘That is a fine woman,’ said the profiteer, staring hard.</p>

<p>‘I do not know her,’ said the priest, somewhat sadly. But the fool ran
forward and caught her hands in his, and they laughed together. So the
priest and the profiteer walked on, but when they had gone a little way,
they turned round, and there was the fool sitting at her feet and
looking into her eyes as she sang and combed her hair.</p>

<p>‘The fool has all the luck,’ they grumbled.<a name="page_004" id="page_004"></a></p>

<h3><a name="A_MOVING_STORY_OF_REAL_LIFE" id="A_MOVING_STORY_OF_REAL_LIFE"></a>A MOVING STORY OF REAL LIFE</h3>

<p class="nind"><span class="letraa">T</span><b>HERE</b> was at one time upon the earth a Mr S. L. Binkle, who always spoke
of himself as a Business Expert. He would, from time to time, scatter
broadcast little sheets of paper, on which was printed: ‘Efficiency!
What does it mean to you?’ and many other dark sayings.</p>

<p>This Binkle was a middle-aged man who lived strangely: he never laughed
or sang or ate heartily, though some have said that he had a weakness
for tapioca pudding.</p>

<p>It chanced that one afternoon when he was sitting in his office, there
was some noisy music in the street near by, so Binkle put small pieces
of cotton-wool in his ears. Far away, the gods laughed.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, the office door was flung open, and a red-faced man
rushed in, crying: ‘You Mister Binkle?... come down to Balham ... next
Tuesday evening ... talk on Business Efficiency ... no time to stop ...
train ... ask for Mechanics Institute ... five guineas.’ After which,
the stranger departed noisily.</p>

<p>These loose fragments of speech were quite intelligible and, indeed,
welcome to Binkle, who made a note in a little book and smiled with
satisfaction.</p>

<p>But alas&mdash;who can foresee what the gods have decreed? For, with the
cotton-wool in his ears, Binkle had not heard the stranger rightly; and
on the Tuesday following, instead of going to Balham, he went to Barham,
which is full of poets and wild lovers, and there he perished
miserably.<a name="page_005" id="page_005"></a></p>

FAMILY</h3>

<p class="nind"><span class="letraa">T</span><b>HE</b> Man who thought about Proteids sat by the roadside, writing with an
indelible pencil in a little notebook. And Spring, all in pink and
white, came tripping by, and cried to him: ‘I will dance for you! Watch
me dance!’ She danced very prettily, but the Man went on writing, and
never looked at her once. So Spring, being young, burst into tears, and
told her sister, Summer.</p>

<p>Summer said to herself: ‘Spring is very foolish to cry. Probably he does
not like dancing. I will sing to him.’ She sang a beautiful sleepy song
to him, but he never listened, being busy writing in his little
note-book. Summer was indignant, and told her sister, Autumn.</p>

<p>Autumn said: ‘There are many good men who do not like dancing. I will
give him some of my wine.’ So she went to the Man and offered him her
purple wine, but he merely said, ‘I do not drink wine,’ and resumed his
writing. Then Autumn was very angry indeed, and told her big brother,
Winter, all that had passed.</p>

<p>Winter was an enormous fellow, with a dreadful roar and howl, and every
time he moved, snowflakes came whirling from his flowing robes. ‘Show me
the fellow,’ he bellowed, puffing out his cheeks. Then he saw the Man
who thought about Proteids, still sitting by the roadside.<a name="page_006" id="page_006"></a></p>

<p>‘Do you know me?’ roared Winter, and the Man looked and his teeth
chattered like dead men’s bones.</p>

<p>Then Winter seized him by the neck and whirled him round and round, and
finally flung him over his left shoulder into space.</p>

<p>And the Man who thought about Proteids has not been seen since, but, the
other day, a boy found the little note-book lying by the roadside.<a name="page_007" id="page_007"></a></p>

<h3><a name="AT_THE_RED_LION_RAMPLE_STREET" id="AT_THE_RED_LION_RAMPLE_STREET"></a>AT THE ‘RED LION,’ RAMPLE STREET</h3>

<p class="nind"><span class="letraa">R</span><b>ATHER</b> late one Saturday evening, Bacchus walked into the ‘Red Lion
Inn,’ at the corner of Rample Street. He said nothing, but looked at the
landlord, who, on his part, was trying to discover the ‘company’
(meaning rank or station) of the new customer; so that he should know
whether to open the door of the Private Bar or Best Room, or wave his
hand in the direction of the Taproom: this is the great problem and test
for all inn-keepers in England.</p>

<p>The landlord was still puzzling his brains, when the god spoke in a
rich, mellow voice: ‘Happy mortal, let us drink and sing together, and
talk of the laughing glories of the world. See! I will garland thy brow
with leaves of vine.’ And he stepped forward.</p>

<p>The landlord recoiled hastily. ‘No you don’t,’ he snarled, ‘you get
nothing ’ere. Outside.’</p>

<p>The god did not move, so the landlord grew angry and cried: ‘Outside I
say! ’Ere Bill! Jack! Throw ’im out!’</p>

<p>Bacchus, taken by surprise, was immediately flung through the swing
doors, landing at the feet of a policeman outside.</p>

<p>On Monday, the god was fined many shillings for being drunk and
disorderly, but fortunately no one in the police-court recognised him,
for that morning he was dressed in an old suit and wore a cloth cap and
red scarf, so that he looked like one of those men who shave only on
Saturday afternoons.<a name="page_008" id="page_008"></a></p>

<h3><a name="THE_DANGER_OF_ACCEPTING_GIFTS_WHILE_HOLDING_MUNICIPAL_OFFICE" id="THE_DANGER_OF_ACCEPTING_GIFTS_WHILE_HOLDING_MUNICIPAL_OFFICE"></a>THE DANGER OF ACCEPTING GIFTS WHILE HOLDING MUNICIPAL OFFICE</h3>

<p class="nind"><span class="letraa">A</span> <b>POET</b>, wishing to remove from Shotterden to Camden Town, found himself
sadly encumbered with dreams and decided to give them away before he
left.</p>

<p>He started with the little cripple girl next door, to whom he gave two
splendid dreams of laughing gardens, and then went all round Shotterden
(it is not a very large town) giving away his dreams.</p>

<p>When he returned to his lodging, he found he had one dream left, so he
went to the policeman who always stood at the corner of the street, and
said: ‘I cannot understand it. I have one dream left, yet I think I have
given one to every person in the town, and to some I have given two.’</p>

<p>‘There is the Mayor&mdash;’ replied the policeman, doubtfully.</p>

<p>‘The very man! I had forgotten him!’ cried the Poet, and ran off to find
the Mayor.</p>

<p>The Mayor accepted the gift very reluctantly, and tried to get rid of
it, but it clung to him persistently, as dreams do. It was a good dream,
a dream of the white neck of a queen who died four thousand years ago,
but the Mayor did not want it.</p>

<p>As time went on, it weighed upon him more and more, and when he should
have been attending to Municipal Affairs or Opening a Bazaar, he found
his mind wandering, and he was for ever brooding on the dead queen.<a name="page_009" id="page_009"></a></p>

<p>Until one day, when the Council was discussing a new Byelaw to prevent
Children from playing in the Public Parks, he was asked to speak, and,
full of the dream, he burst into song, to the great astonishment of all
present. He was then asked to resign, which he did.</p>

<p>And now, hardly anyone ever calls or even leaves a card.<a name="page_010" id="page_010"></a></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letraa">T</span><b>HE</b> great Babylonian god, Marduk, revisiting the earth in the guise of a
young man, fell in love with a girl in the silk Department of the
Universal Stores. Her name was Lena.</p>

<p>‘O moon-faced one! O white flower of the world! I adore thee,’ Marduk
whispered. ‘Thou hast the look of Sarpanitum, the leopard-eyed goddess,
in days of old when the stars were young and kind!’</p>

<p>‘Well, well,’ cried Lena, ‘what will you do to please me?’</p>

<p>‘I will rebuild Babylon in an hour for thee,’ shouted the god, and away
he sped to the great, silent plain, where he laboured mightily. In a
short space of time he returned and wafted her away to the scene of his
labouring.</p>

<p>‘Look, look,’ he cried, and waved his hand. And there was Babylon, the
mighty city of splendour and dream, shimmering and glittering, the
wonder of the world. There were the great gates, the towering palaces,
the hanging gardens, as of old.</p>

<p>‘Well?’ and Marduk turned to her eagerly when she had gazed her fill,
and wiped his forehead, for even he sweated from his vast labours.</p>

<p>Lena looked at him: ‘Yes, it’s very nice,’ she said.<a name="page_011" id="page_011"></a></p>

<h3><a name="HOW_THE_RATIONAL_AMUSEMENTS_OF_THE_GREAT_ARE_LIMITED" id="HOW_THE_RATIONAL_AMUSEMENTS_OF_THE_GREAT_ARE_LIMITED"></a>HOW THE RATIONAL AMUSEMENTS OF THE GREAT ARE LIMITED</h3>

<p class="nind"><span class="letraa">B</span><b>EFORE</b> your time, two Mummers and a Unitarian were seated in a tavern
playing cards, when a long, sallow-faced man, dressed in black, joined
them and asked if he might have a game.</p>

<p>He was received cordially, and Whist was proposed, the civilisation of
the world not having arrived at Bridge at that time.</p>

<p>The Unitarian dealt out the cards, and the Man in black sorted and
scrutinized his hand in the manner of one who takes a keen interest in
the game.</p>

<p>‘By the way, what are trumps?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘Hearts,’ replied one of the Mummers.</p>

<p>‘Hearts! Hearts! Red Hearts!’ screamed the Man in black, springing to
his feet and spilling his cards in anger. ‘How the myself can I play
with hearts as trumps! Any other suit would have done splendidly!’ And,
with a loud cry, he jumped through the floor, and as he went the others
caught a glimpse, through the crack, of flames, curling and leaping.</p>

<p>It is not recorded whether the Unitarian was the more surprised or the
two Mummers.<a name="page_012" id="page_012"></a></p>

Hostel, where, round a bright fire, were seated the three Watchers,
Arshel of the Twisted Nose, Zanoah of the Bright Hair, and the other
whose name I can never remember.</p>

<p>They gave him greeting, and he sat down and warmed his hands by the
fire.</p>

<p>Presently, Arshel turned to him and said, ‘Sing us a song.’</p>

<p>The Member of Parliament said with dignity, ‘I cannot sing.’</p>

<p>The three Watchers sighed and looked at him reproachfully.</p>

<p>‘Then dance for us,’ said Zanoah, picking up a little pipe.</p>

<p>‘I cannot dance,’ returned the Member of Parliament sadly. The three
Watchers sighed more deeply.</p>

<p>‘Then tell us a tale,’ said the one whose name I can never remember. The
Politician pondered for a moment, then began:</p>

<p>‘At the last General Election it was decided that our Party should
appeal to the country to support those studied and careful reforms
necessary from time to time in an enlightened community like ours.
Questions of Tariff, Extension of the Franchise, Disestablishment of the
Church, Free Commercial<a name="page_013" id="page_013"></a> Education for the Masses, were to be the
pillars by which our Party should stand or fall. I myself&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘It is too long,’ cried Arshel.</p>

<p>‘It is a poor tale,’ cried Zanoah.</p>

<p>‘It is the worst tale I have ever heard,’ cried the one whose name I can
never remember, ‘and you are no company for us.’</p>

<p>So they thrust the Member of Parliament for West Churchling out into the
cold night.<a name="page_014" id="page_014"></a></p>

<p>In the centre of the crowd was a small cleared space, in which was
seated, on the edge of the pavement, a strange being with dark blue hair
and greenish-tinted skin.</p>

<p>‘Nah then,’ said the policeman, pulling out his note-book, ‘wot’s all
this?’</p>

<p>The strange being, on whom the gift of tongues must have descended,
looked up and said: ‘Where am I?’</p>

<p>‘Come on. Wot’s the game, eh? Who are yer, eh? Wotcher doing ’ere?’
roared the policeman, his surprise making him more truculent than usual.</p>

<p>The strange being made no reply, but stared at the policeman, and then
looked gravely at the curious, jostling crowd.</p>

<p>‘I know! I know!’ he cried triumphantly, springing to his feet. ‘I’m
on&mdash;just a minute, I’ll remember&mdash;somewhere in the Solar system&mdash;I’ve

his little white boat. We were old acquaintances, and I asked him if the
gods were still using him kindly, and how things were looking on the
Moon, his home.</p>

<p>‘I have been away from home for some time,’ he replied, ‘but am just
about to return. Will you come with me?’</p>

<p>So I clambered into his little boat, and told my own ship to return to
the Island of Fata Morgana. We sailed on and on, Pierrot enlivening the
dim hours with his strange Moon-songs, until at last he brought the boat
to anchor in a little bay, and I landed, for the first time, at the pale
country of the Moon.</p>

<p>‘You know,’ I said to Pierrot, as we wandered among the fantastic green
shadows, ‘I have always longed to visit the Moon. The World is so dull,
now, and the Moon always seemed to us such a mad and merry place.’</p>

<p>Pierrot stared&mdash;‘That is very strange! Up here we have always believed
the reverse of that. And with good reason. Look for yourself!’ and he
led me to the edge of the Moon; we peered over, and there, far below,
was the great shining World, looking as big as ten Moons, and a hundred
times madder and merrier.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letraa">A</span> <b>CERTAIN</b> rich man, having discovered a new method of adulterating milk
for babies, determined to celebrate his increase of fortune by giving a
wonderful Fancy-dress Ball and masked Carnival.</p>

<p>When the evening came, the scene was a very brilliant one, the masks and
costumes being of a most varied and extravagant character. About
midnight, a new figure was noticed moving slowly among the crowd, a tall
figure dressed in a long black cloak with a cowl, which overshadowed a
grinning ghastly Death’s Head. This extraordinary costume caused much
comment; some of the more timid guests objected to it, but the majority
found it entertaining and wondered who the wearer might be.</p>

<p>At one o’clock, prizes were to be given for the best costumes. Amid
general applause, the Master of the Ceremonies handed the first prize to
a lady dressed as Madame de Pompadour. He then cried loudly: ‘The second
prize goes to the gentleman who has come in the character of Death.’</p>

<p>All eyes were turned upon the strange figure, which stepped forward and
said in a loud voice: ‘I cannot accept the prize. I have won too many
prizes.’</p>

<p>This occasioned some remark, but the prize was given elsewhere, and in a
few minutes the distribution was at an end.</p>

<p>Then the Master gave the signal for all masks to be removed, and the
guests regarded each other with flushed and happy faces. There was one
exception<a name="page_017" id="page_017"></a> however, and the master called loudly to Death’s Head, who
stood somewhat apart from the rest: ‘Sir, remove your mask.’</p>

<p>The figure pulled back the cowl, exposing its horrible grinning head to
the light, then turned slowly as if to survey every person in the room.</p>

<p>‘I wear no mask,’ it said, simply.<a name="page_018" id="page_018"></a></p>

man, a wretched, dusty, unkempt dotard, entered at the far end, and
shuffled swiftly along the room. And as he passed the little tables, the
crowds of women there smiled on him, threw him flowers, tried to seize
his hand, and endeavoured in a hundred ways to attract his attention and
win his regard.</p>

<p>‘Now, this is surely the strangest thing that ever happened,’ I said, as
the old man approached; ‘is he a famous poet, then, or has he a
cellar-full of diamonds, that the women should love him so!’</p>

<p>He must have heard me, or noted the surprise written on my face, for
when he came closer, he stayed his feet for a moment, and muttered in my
ear:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘I was ever a great lady-killer! My name is Time’; and he chuckled

very rich. For this, he was made a lord, and was known henceforth as
Lord Roasbif. So he bought a large estate in the country, and lived the
life of a good old English country gentleman.</p>

<p>Nothing delighted my Lord Roasbif more than to speak to large concourses
of simple people, so on an evil night in November he went to the
Agricultural Hall in Bosmouth, a small town on the east coast, to speak
at a political meeting.</p>

<p>A large crowd awaited him in the hall, and the organist played ‘Hearts
of Oak’ four times.</p>

<p>No one heard, from afar, a murmuring sound that gradually grew louder
and louder.</p>

<p>There was a great clapping of hands when Lord Roasbif stood up, so that
his heart was warmed and he spoke well, touching on matters political
and social.</p>

<p>A few people at the back of the hall heard a strange sound.</p>

<p>My Lord Roasbif was almost inspired, and spoke of the ‘Glorious Embire’
and ‘Our Island Raze’ with wonderful fervour. But now the noise outside
had grown very much louder, and all the people looked at each other in
wonder and fear. There seemed to be a prodigious high tide.</p>

<p>‘Chentlemen,’ cried Roasbif, ‘gome whad may, our Embire is sdill, and
and always vill be as long as de Bridish raze remains&mdash;mistress of&mdash;’</p>

he knew the tune, the only tune, to which Death would dance, and he
could play it well. Now the Fiddler, though he had but poor health, had
no great reason to fear Death, and he wedded with a girl from a
neighbouring village.</p>

<p>On the night following the wedding, there was a merry company assembled
at the house of the Fiddler, and everyone was talking, laughing or
singing, when suddenly there was a tapping at the window. The Fiddler
looked out and saw Death beckoning to him. So, not wishing to disturb
his guests, he picked up his fiddle and went out of the house.</p>

<p>Remembering the tune, however, he did not wait for Death to speak, but
straightway began to play, and Death, his bones rattling, started
dancing in the moonlight.</p>

<p>The guests, missing their host and hearing the music, crowded to the
window, but all they could see was the Fiddler jigging madly away. ‘He
wants us to dance outside in the moonlight,’ cried one, and out they all
went, and danced merrily with Death, who was becoming a little weary, in
the middle.</p>

<p>‘I hate parties&mdash;except in time of plague or war’, panted Death to the
Fiddler, and he danced away out of sight, and the Fiddler never saw him
again for many, many years.<a name="page_021" id="page_021"></a></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letraa">M</span><b>ARUS</b>, a young poet of Levion, was walking in the by-ways of that city,
one day, when he came to a great door which he had never seen before,
and above the door was written in letters of gold:</p>

<p class="lspc">‘<small>THE COLLEGE OF IMMORTAL FAME</small>’</p>

<p class="nind">So Marus knocked loudly at the door, and when it was opened, said to the
Porter: ‘I desire to enter the College.’</p>

<p>‘Do you desire it more than anything else in the whole world?’ asked the
Porter, in a solemn voice.</p>

<p>‘I do,’ said Marus, whose curiosity was awakened.</p>

<p>He entered, and was surprised to find that the door was immediately
locked and bolted behind him, and that two sentinels with drawn swords
took their places in front of it. He found himself in a great hall, and
nothing could be heard but sighing and groaning from every side. An old
man with a long white beard came towards Marus, and laying his hand on
the poet’s shoulder, said: ‘You will stay in this College for the
remainder of your lifetime. Little food, less sleep, no rest, occasional
moments of ecstasy in years of despair!’</p>

<p>‘I have made a mistake,’ muttered Marus, and louder: ‘I cannot stay
here.’</p>

<p>‘You cannot escape now,’ said the old man, quite gently.</p>

<p>The young poet looked about him and spied a little door at the far end
of the hall. ‘Yes, I can!’ he<a name="page_022" id="page_022"></a> cried, and ran towards the little door,
hoping to find it unlocked. It was; and, his heart flooded with relief,
he swung open the door and looked out.</p>

an Angel, who promised to be my guide in the Strange Lands.</p>

<p>We saw innumerable cities, gardens, palaces, castles, all beautiful, but
in a thousand and one different ways. And moving here, there and
everywhere, were happy souls clad in multi-coloured, shimmering
garments.</p>

<p>‘It makes my heart rejoice,’ I said to the Angel, ‘to see all these
happy souls. But tell me, what brain devised, what hand built, these
bewildering beautiful places?’</p>

<p>‘They were fashioned by the souls themselves, a long time ago,’ replied
the Angel enigmatically. A little later, my companion said: ‘I will show
you something different!’ And together, we flew away from the cities and
castles, until we came to a great, flat plain or desert, on which there
was neither building nor tree, nor even rock. ‘Surely this is the most
desolate place in the Universe and the Seven Heavens,’ I said, as we
still flew over the great plain.</p>

<p>‘Look,’ cried the Angel, pointing. I looked and saw far away, in the
centre of the great plain, one solitary, little soul.</p>

<p>‘Now that is loneliness and desolation indeed,’ I said, ‘what strange
and terrible sins did this man commit, that his soul should be confined
to such a place?’</p>

<p>‘On earth,’ replied the Angel, somewhat indifferently, ‘he prided
himself on having no Imagination!’<a name="page_024" id="page_024"></a></p>

<p>‘Nothing but trees,’ replied the first old man, shaking his head, ‘and
that, as you will find, is the great sorrow of life.’</p>

<p>To the second old man, the child said: ‘What shall I come to, if I go
beyond the hills?’</p>

<p>‘You will come back to this very place in time,’ he answered,
mournfully, ‘and that is the saddest thing in the world.’</p>

<p>The child turned to the third old man, who was sighing deeply, and
asked: ‘Why are you so sad?’</p>

<p>‘We are sad,’ said the third old man, ‘because the vanishing years have
taught us wisdom, and we know all things. But you, being young, know
nothing.’</p>

<p>And the three old men shook their heads in unison and hobbled away.</p>

<p>The child stood still and puzzled for a moment. Then it said to itself:
‘They did not answer those questions properly. They are wrong, but I do
not know why.’</p>

great black object nearby, which seemed to form the base of a vast

to <i>him</i> yet.&mdash;I haven’t seen his Highness&mdash;but, of course, you know the

spoke at great length. Throughout his address, he continually referred
to Demos and never without some touch of scorn. These contemptuous
references to Demos were apparently understood and approved of by all
present, with one strange exception.</p>

<p>For there was one fellow at this meeting who never should have been
there, a wild, half-witted fellow, noted throughout the town as an idler
and one given over to foolish laughter and odd scraps of song. Now this
fool, instead of holding his peace, immediately began to denounce the
learned man because he had spoken of Demos.</p>

<p>‘Who is this Demos?’&mdash;the fool went about crying. ‘I have been in the

treasures and many of the wonderful sights of the empire, that the
traveller might spread the fame of Ol-fin.</p>

<p>One day, when Agal had announced his intention of returning to his own
country, the emperor said: ‘I have one other thing for you to see, and
it is the most wonderful of all. It was given to me by the great god
Aoh. Come, I will show you.’ And he led him through the palace, along
innumerable corridors, until they came to a narrow, steep flight of
stairs. These they mounted, until they came to a small apartment which
appeared to be at the top of a high tower.</p>

<p>It had but one window, which was closely shuttered. ‘O Agal,
much-travelled one,’ cried the emperor, ‘you shall see a sight you have
never seen before,’ and he flung back the shutters.</p>

<p>Agal looked through the window, and was amazed at what he saw. ‘The dust
of seven times seven kingdoms has been about my feet,’ he cried, ‘yet I
never saw such beauty before. Strange, that I know the sight, yet I have
never seen it before. It must have come in dreams!’</p>

reign, but, after a little while, the King waved them aside. ‘You bore
us,’ he said. ‘Let us have music,’ the King commanded, and the most
skilled musicians in the kingdom came and played before him. But the
music was so passionately sorrowful, joyous, heart-stirring, that the
King wept. ‘Go away,’ he cried, ‘we would make Death easy, but your
music is the enemy of Death!’</p>

<p>Then the Monarch ordered all the members of the Royal Family to come to
his bedside, that he might spend his last hours in loving discourse with
his kindred. But when they came, they wept so bitterly, that the King’s
heart was turned to water within him, and he commanded them to depart.</p>

<p>The King was fretful.</p>

<p>‘How many different religions are there in the kingdom?’ he enquired of
the chamberlain.</p>

<p>‘Sire, there are six great religions, and one hundred and seventy-two
different sects,’ replied that worthy.</p>

voice: ‘We have commanded your presence here that you may explain the
means we must adopt to secure the happiness of our immortal soul in the
next world. You may begin.’ And he sank back again into his pillows.</p>

<p>Then the six Chief Priests all began to talk at once, explaining their
different systems, and they quarrelled and argued one with another,

guess from my faltering speech. Pray tell me what these poor fellows
have done that they should be thus handled.’</p>

<p>The stranger replied, with some heat: ‘Sir, you may well ask that. These

are lovers of Truth and Freedom, and so have become the victims of that
vile tyranny which passes here for government. They are all&mdash;as you can
see&mdash;noble and virtuous&mdash;the friends of society.’ So John James went on
his way, grieved that the country should be so badly served.</p>

<p>Five years later, however, he found himself in the same city. Again, he
saw a number of men being driven through the streets to the gaol. And
again he turned to one who was standing near, but found him no stranger,
for it was no other than the man he had questioned before.</p>

<p>‘Tell me,’ said John James, ‘what these poor fellows have done that they
should lose their freedom, or perhaps their lives.’</p>

<p>The other replied with more heat than before: ‘Sir, that is quickly
answered. These fellows&mdash;<a name="page_032" id="page_032"></a>insolent scoundrels all of them&mdash;have opposed
our God-appointed rulers. Such ruffians are the enemies of Freedom and
Truth, and deserve the fate that our just government has appointed for
them. They are all&mdash;as you can see&mdash;vicious and depraved&mdash;the enemies of

World. There I met an Angel, sitting on a great flat stone.</p>

<p>‘Tell me, Angel,’ I said, ‘what do you do in the High Hall of Heaven in
the long evenings?’</p>

<p>‘We tell tales,’ replied the Angel, ‘but they are better tales than you
have ever heard or read. Go burn your books, and sit among the crows
until you can understand their tongue!’</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letraa">C</span><b>OMING</b> to the conclusion of the whole matter, the present writer, who
has more than once gone over all that has been written on the
subject&mdash;with the exception of some things in Romansch and Czech&mdash;while
he has been engaged on this task, must refuse to discuss at length the
motives of the mice or the far-reaching results to their seemingly
(though not to the literary critic or historian who has adopted the
comparative method) eccentric and ill-timed trick of ‘running after,’
both of which have engaged the attention of some very excellent persons
to the exclusion of all other aspects of the problem. Whoever looks at
such things with one eye open for the swing of the pendulum will not be
easily persuaded that the cleaving blade&mdash;for, let it be repeated, the
Farmer’s Wife is worthiest of attention here&mdash;has not the fullest
significance of all, from the <i>lever de rideau</i> of the ‘running after’
to the noisy epilogue of the ‘Never saw such a thing in my life.’ To
some, whose <i>engouement</i> for the Classical is not entirely absurd, the
structure of the three shorn rodents, in their new simplicity and
austerity of outline, will come almost as a ‘Pisgah-sight.’ As a
reaction from the fulltailed Romanticism that scampered blindly and
heedlessly after what seemed rather a new crotchet than a true ideal,
their attitude&mdash;not<a name="page_042" id="page_042"></a> unforeseen at the time when the ‘Carving-knife’ was
first menacingly brandished&mdash;can at least be tolerated. But to the other
extremists, who from their stucco citadel of the sham Romantic have
derided the ‘cutting-off,’ and have hailed with contempt the new-old,
perhaps to them unfamiliar, form of the blind three, the present writer
can hold out no eirenicon. With the exception of some worthy persons who
ought to have known better, and who shall be nameless here, the scoffers
were for the most part half-educated journalists and other hangers-on to
letters, who imagine that it is possible to write a clear lucid style
without so much as a glance at Dionysius of Halicarnassus, and who
cannot be expected.... Etc., Etc.<a name="page_043" id="page_043"></a></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letraa">B</span><b>EAR</b> with me, gentlemen, while I return, not unrefreshed by an eight
months’ interval&mdash;‘apart sat on a hill retired,’ to the argument of my
last lecture but one, wherein we found that the Capital Difficulty of
Criticism consisted in keeping to the matter in hand. ‘When you wander,
as you often delight to do, you wander indeed, and give never such
satisfaction as the curious time requires.’ So Bacon, in his letter of
expostulation to Coke; and we shall do well to perpend the passage
without taking to ourselves that plea of ‘having a large and fruitful
mind’ which Bacon, in his wisdom, presented to Coke. Let us hold by the
words of a writer whom our Tripos is gradually restoring to popular
favour, Quintilian&mdash;‘it is enough for us to mind our present business.’
Suffer me then to proffer a personal experience. Once, when an
undergraduate, I ... [<i>anecdote omitted</i>] ... an unforgettable
experience, at least to one who is willing to pass among you as a
sentimental old Victorian. But let us tune our instruments. And this
brings me&mdash;for, believe me, gentlemen, I must eventually arrive
somewhere&mdash;to the point I wish to make. It is this, that if we examine
our literature curiously, we shall find there a certain thread, a cord
of silver, twisting its way through all Letters and linking up one noble
author with another. Let<a name="page_045" id="page_045"></a> me remind you that this thread was first spun
in Greece ... [<i>passages on compulsory Greek, the Education Act of 1870,
and the Teaching of English in Schools&mdash;omitted</i>]. You may realise,
gentlemen, how this tradition has been kept alive by men often sundered
from one another by generations, if you allow me to bring before you
several illuminating passages from diverse authors whose names are not
pronounced here for the first time.... [<i>Quotations from Aristotle,
Longinus, Cervantes, Lessing, Sainte-Beuve, Newman, and Walter de la
Mare omitted.</i>] One and all of these craftsmen, whom it is our business
to study, tell us that we shall abjure the direct method only at our
peril, that ultimately we shall come by more profit if we keep to the
narrow road and leave the hedgerows and fields beyond innocent of our
feet. It will not be easy. But&mdash;and I thank heaven for it!&mdash;literature
is not easy; and even in these days, when the Correspondence School
flourisheth and Pelman is in the land, no one, not I nor another, can
make it so.<a name="page_046" id="page_046"></a></p>
